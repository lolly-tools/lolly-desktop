# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY THIS SPEC LOOKS LIKE THIS
#
# Lolly's desktop app is a Tauri 2 shell whose *frontend is the web shell*: the
# Vite build is rooted at shells/web and the resulting dist/ is embedded into the
# Rust binary at compile time by tauri-build's generate_context!(). That means:
#
#   1. dist/ must be built BEFORE cargo runs, by node+npm, against the whole
#      umbrella repo (submodules, workspaces, and the generated tools/+catalog/
#      profile views). OBS builds are offline, so that cannot happen here.
#      => dist/ is PREBUILT and shipped inside Source0. See ./make-sources.sh.
#
#   2. Every cargo crate must be present offline.
#      => Source1 is a `cargo vendor` tree, wired up by Source2.
#
#   3. ort-sys (ONNX Runtime, used by the native reword feature in
#      src-tauri/src/reword.rs) DOWNLOADS a prebuilt ONNX Runtime in its build
#      script via ureq. That is fatal offline. Setting ORT_LIB_LOCATION makes
#      ort-sys skip the download entirely and link the library we hand it
#      (build.rs: `cfg!(feature = "download-binaries") && env::var(ORT_LIB_LOCATION).is_err()`).
#      The tarball we ship is byte-identical to the one ort-sys would have
#      fetched - make-sources.sh reads the URL and SHA256 straight out of the
#      vendored ort-sys dist.txt, so it cannot drift from the pinned crate.
#      It contains onnxruntime/lib/libonnxruntime.a, so this links STATICALLY
#      and the resulting RPM has no libonnxruntime runtime dependency. That is
#      what makes one spec work on Tumbleweed and Leap 16 alike, neither of
#      which ships onnxruntime in the OSS repo.

# The tray dlopens libayatana-appindicator3 LAZILY, so rpm's automatic dependency
# finder never sees it - the ELF carries no DT_NEEDED for it. Without this line the
# package installs happily on a system that lacks the library and the app then dies
# on launch, which is exactly how it shipped in 1.0.2. Depend on the soname rather
# than a package name so it resolves on Tumbleweed and Leap alike, whatever either
# calls the containing package.
Requires:       libayatana-appindicator3.so.1()(64bit)
# The url-shot tool drives a headless Chrome over the DevTools Protocol
# (src-tauri/src/capture.rs). Everything else works without it, so this is a
# Recommends, not a Requires - the app starts and renders fine with no browser.
Recommends:     chromium

%description
Lolly is a constraint-first, template-driven tool for generating on-brand
creative assets - QR codes, charts, diagrams, event badges, documents, filters
and more - as PNG, SVG, PDF or video.

Tools are data, not code: a manifest, a template and optional hooks, so new
tools ship without updating the application. Everything renders on your
device; nothing is uploaded.

# Cargo vendor tree + the config that points cargo at it, so the build is offline.
# The config MUST land in src-tauri/.cargo/config.toml and the build MUST run with
# src-tauri as its working directory: cargo discovers config by walking up from the
# CWD, and resolves a relative `directory =` against the directory holding .cargo/ -
# so "vendor" means src-tauri/vendor only under those two conditions. Do not set
# CARGO_HOME to this directory; that turns it into the home config instead, where the
# same relative path resolves somewhere else entirely.

# MEMORY. The final rustc invocation links lolly-desktop with the ENTIRE frontend
# embedded by generate_context!() (~175 MB of assets) plus a statically linked ONNX
# Runtime, in one process with a large peak RSS. %%limit_build is openSUSE's idiom for
# bounding that: it caps parallel jobs by available memory, so a constrained OBS worker
# throttles instead of dying. Precautionary - a build worker with little RAM per core is
# the case it protects.
#
# It is NOT what fixed the OOM seen while developing this spec. That was rustc getting
# SIGKILLed with no diagnostic, and the cause was the build tree sitting on a tmpfs
# /tmp - so several GB of "disk" were actually resident memory. Build on real disk;
# the same mistake also reports itself as "Disk quota exceeded (os error 122)" once
# tmpfs hits its ceiling. Neither message mentions tmpfs.
# Guarded on BOTH the distro and the macro, because each alone is wrong:
#
#   - distro alone (%if 0%{?suse_version}) is not enough: %%limit_build ships with the
#     OBS build macros, not base rpm-build, so it is undefined on Tumbleweed under a
#     plain rpmbuild - and an undefined macro is emitted verbatim into the shell
#     script, where `%%limit_build -m 3000` is a command-not-found that kills %build
#     before a single crate compiles.
#
#   - macro alone (%%{?limit_build:...}) is not enough either: TWO DIFFERENT MACROS
#     SHARE THE NAME. openSUSE's is a statement that sets _smp_mflags. Fedora's, from
#     redhat-rpm-config, is an *expression* returning a -jN flag for use inside
#     %make_build, and invoking it this way makes its Lua do tonumber(nil) and abort
#     the parse with "attempt to perform arithmetic on a nil value". That breaks the
#     plain-rpmbuild smoke test on another distro that README.md documents.
# NB: the %%limit_build spellings in the comments above are escaped on purpose -
# rpm expands macros INSIDE COMMENTS, and a bare `%%limit_build -m 3000` in prose
# invokes Fedora's macro with a trailing backtick in its argument, so tonumber()
# returns nil and the whole spec fails to parse. Do not unescape them.
%if 0%{?suse_version}
%{?limit_build:%limit_build -m 3000}

# --features tauri/custom-protocol is NOT optional. It is what the Tauri CLI adds for
# you, and tauri's own is_dev() is literally `!cfg!(feature = "custom-protocol")`
# (tauri/src/lib.rs:309), so a plain `cargo build` produces a DEVELOPMENT binary that
# ignores the embedded frontendDist and tries to load devUrl instead. The packaged app
# would start, show a window, and fail with "Could not connect to localhost: Connection
# refused". Nothing in the build log warns about it - the tell is the binary coming out
# roughly a third of its proper size, which %check below now guards.
# %{?_smp_mflags} is what makes %%limit_build above actually DO something: the macro
# only sets _smp_mflags, so without passing it here cargo would still fan out to every
# core and the memory cap would be inert. Cargo accepts the same -jN spelling make does.

%changelog
* Sun Aug 30 2026 Andy Fitzsimon <andyfitz@gmail.com> - 1.0.2-0
- Flatpak parity: the from-source Flathub manifest now installs the same
  freedesktop integration this spec already did (MIME type, thumbnailer, GNOME
  Shell search provider, D-Bus activation). No change to the RPM's own payload.

* Sun Aug 30 2026 Andy Fitzsimon <andyfitz@gmail.com> - 1.0.1-0
- Linux desktop integration (plans/174): .lolly file association + thumbnailer,
  lolly:// deep links, XDG-portal colour picker and wallpaper, GNOME Shell and
  KRunner search providers, clipboard-lens tray, hot folder, org.lolly.Desktop1
  D-Bus automation surface.

* Sat Aug 29 2026 Andy Fitzsimon <andyfitz@gmail.com> - 1.0.0-0
- First packaged release: tool gallery, brand studio, on-device export.
