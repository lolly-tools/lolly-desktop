# not one. The container owns those headers; node and cargo come from the host.

# dist/ is built HERE, on the host, and tauri's beforeBuildCommand is then
# emptied. That is not a shortcut - `tauri build` re-runs beforeBuildCommand
# itself, and unless LOLLY_EMBED_CATALOG survives into that re-run it rebuilds
# dist/ in the default 'neutral' mode and silently drops the tool previews.
